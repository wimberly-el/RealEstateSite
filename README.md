# RealEstate-Blog
This is the current state of the blog thanks to two different resources. 

The next step is
1. Adding a way to subscribe to the newsletter -- somewhat finished. The new plan is to just make a link to the subscribe page. After they subscribe they're redirected to a page that confirms the subscription. 
Or sends a notification that it didn't work. 
2. Adding a way to login to make changes to the website. This includes hiding things
3. Reintroduce the home page
4. Use the blogger site: https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_theme_company.asp


I started making changes to the email and things aren't working

you can return things to where they were by removing the email stuff and maybe makit it it's own page

commented out a constant on emails.js in routes
