# RealEstate-Blog
This is the current state of the blog thanks to two different resources. 

The next step is
1. Adding a way to subscribe to the newsletter -- somewhat finished. The new plan is to just make a link to the subscribe page. After they subscribe they're redirected to a page that confirms the subscription. 
Or sends a notification that it didn't work. 
2. Adding a way to login to make changes to the website. This includes hiding things
3. Reintroduce the home page



I started making changes to the email and things aren't working

you can return things to where they were by removing the email stuff and maybe makit it it's own page

commented out a constant on emails.js in routes

DEC 22 2020 -- the user can login and it'll change the view by IP and the userId

dec 26 
-- the look needs to be cleaned up



DEC 28
- create instruction manual for making any and all changes
- add the word florest to the page -- right under the logo
- find a purple castle logo in the meantime
- fill in the front page
- migrate his stuff onto his own accounts
- prepare to give everything off to him
